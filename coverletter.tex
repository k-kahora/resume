Dear Hiring Manager,

% Body
\vspace{12pt}
I was made aware of the Software Engineer position at DoorDash through a LinkedIn post shared by Steven Pungdumri, which my professor forwarded to me via email. This opportunity immediately caught my interest, and I am writing to express my keen intent to apply.

With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from The College of New Jersey, coupled with hands-on software engineering experience, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. My background includes a previous internship with Northwestern Mutual, where I honed my skills in software engineering and deepened my understanding of databasesâ€”a subject I explored in depth during my coursework.

Throughout my academic and personal projects, I have developed a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, primarily using Python. However, my interest in exploring more structured programming paradigms led me to shift my focus towards languages like OCaml. This transition was motivated by my desire to tackle complex programming challenges with a more robust type system, reflecting my enthusiasm for continuous learning and adaptation.

My experience extends beyond programming languages. Since my freshman year, I have embraced Emacs and delved into Linux for software development, with NixOS being my chosen operating system for several years. This has not only broadened my technical expertise but also my perspective on problem-solving and programming as a whole, which I often pursue as a recreational activity.

Furthermore, I have a strong grasp of version control systems, a skill I acquired and appreciated well before it was introduced in my academic curriculum. This early exposure has given me a significant advantage in collaborative projects, underscoring my readiness to contribute to a team environment effectively.

I am excited about the possibility of bringing my diverse skill set and passion for software engineering to DoorDash. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.\vspace{12pt}
