Dear Hiring Manager,

% Body
My name is Malcolm Kahora. The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) holds a special place in my heart, as both of my parents had the privilege of contributing to its mission and have shared their positive experiences with me extensively. I am eagerly looking forward to starting my career in a meaningful role that aligns with my passion for technology and my desire to make a positive impact, making the DEP an ideal choice.

I am set to graduate soon and have been actively seeking opportunities that allow me to apply and further develop my technical skills within a supportive and dynamic environment. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in SQL through hands-on experience in both my databases and software engineering classes. Notably, I have utilized SQL commands within Postgresql, which has enhanced my understanding of database management and data manipulation.

My enthusiasm for technology extends beyond my academic pursuits. I am deeply fascinated by all aspects of technology and programming, and I am confident in my ability to excel in any role that allows me to engage with computers and software development. My constant drive to learn and adapt ensures that I am always exploring new ways to refine my skills and stay abreast of industry advancements.

I am particularly drawn to the prospect of contributing to the DEP not only because of its meaningful work but also due to its commitment to leveraging technology to achieve its goals. I am eager to bring my background in software engineering and computer science to your team, where I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and interests align with the goals of the DEP. \\
