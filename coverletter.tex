Dear Hiring Manager,

% Body
I was introduced to the Software Engineer position at DoorDash through a LinkedIn post by Steven Pungdumri, as recommended by my professor. This opportunity aligns closely with my academic background and internship experiences, compelling me to apply.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from The College of New Jersey, where I developed my skills in programming, algorithms, and data structures. My internship at Northwestern Mutual allowed me to work on large datasets and refine my expertise in version control using Git, preparing me for collaborative development environments like DoorDash's engineering team.

My technical explorations, including diving into OCaml and utilizing Emacs and Linux, underscore my commitment to continuous learning and problem-solving. These experiences have equipped me to contribute effectively to DoorDash's mission of delivering reliable, scalable technology solutions.

I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set at DoorDash and contribute to your team's success. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

\vspace{50pt}
Malcolm Kahora
