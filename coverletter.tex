% Opening
Dear Hiring Manager,

% Body
I already have a positive connection with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), both my parents
had the privilege of contributing to its mission and shared their experiences with me. I am eagerly
looking forward to starting my career in a meaningful role that aligns with my interest for technology
while supporting the effort to protect the environment and historical resources of New Jersey.
% NOTE Last sentance way to long

This May, I am set to graduate with a BS in Computer Science from The College of New Jersey. I have been
actively seeking opportunities that allow me to apply and further develop my technical skills within a supportive and dynamic environment. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in SQL through hands-on experience in both my databases and software engineering classes. Notably, as part of a classwork assignment I utilized SQL command with Postgresql to build a database of
users that registered for a webinar.  

% NOTE Add SQL specific things

My enthusiasm for technology extends beyond my academic pursuits. I am deeply fascinated by all aspects of technology and programming, and I can excel in any role that allows me to engage with computers and software development.

% NOTE reduce this super long sentance
% NOTE OCAML learning OCAML that is my interest
% NOTE UNZIP 

I am particularly drawn to the prospect of contributing to the DEP not only because of its meaningful work but also due to its commitment to leveraging technology to achieve its goals. I am eager to bring my background in software engineering and computer science to your team, where I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution.

% FIXME put the boyscout stuff
% NOTE CIVIC responsiblities are the important part
% NOTE Working for the community in some capacity
% Leverage technology to acheive their goals
% NOTE Look up Joe Eager

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and interests align with the goals of the DEP. \\

Sincerely,\\
