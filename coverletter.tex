% Opening
Dear Hiring Manager,

% Body
The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) holds a special place in my heart, as both of my parents had the privilege of contributing to its mission and have shared their positive experiences with me extensively. I am eagerly looking forward to starting my career in a meaningful role that aligns with my interest for technology and my desire to make a positive impact.
% NOTE Last sentance way to long

I am set to graduate soon and have been actively seeking opportunities that allow me to apply and further develop my technical skills within a supportive and dynamic environment. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in SQL through hands-on experience in both my databases and software engineering classes. Notably, I have utilized SQL commands within Postgresql, this was part of a project working for EndNJC (End New Jim Crow) which is a non-profit orginazatioin.  There I built a database to store users that would sign up for webinars using SQL to store that information.

% NOTE Add SQL specific things

My enthusiasm for technology extends beyond my academic pursuits. I am deeply fascinated by all aspects of technology and programming, and I can excel in any role that allows me to engage with computers and software development.

% NOTE reduce this super long sentance
% NOTE OCAML learning OCAML that is my interest
% NOTE UNZIP 

As an eagle scout I have experience with working on volounteer work and understand the importance of helping the community.

I am particularly drawn to the prospect of contributing to the DEP not only because of its meaningful work but also due to its commitment to leveraging technology to achieve its goals. I am eager to bring my background in software engineering and computer science to your team, where I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution.

% FIXME put the boyscout stuff
% NOTE CIVIC responsiblities are the important part
% NOTE Working for the community in some capacity
% Leverage technology to acheive their goals
% NOTE Look up Joe Eager

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and interests align with the goals of the DEP. \\
